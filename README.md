## Micronaut
### An oceanic terrain and environment simulation from the first hand perspective of a dinoflagellate, a microscopic aquatic organism.

I was involved in devoloping this game, which used field collected 3D point cloud data of microscopic corals to accurately simulate an oceanic ecosystem, at a microscopic scale. The 3D point cloud data first had to be visualized and rendered before it could be added to the game environment as objects. My tasks in devoloping the game involved managing the game scenes on Unity to ensure intuitive navigation through the game and writing short C# scripts to apply water shaders on the environment to provide the user with an authentic under-sea experience.

The player is able to swim in the ocean, and navigate across the entire 3D space within the game boundaries using arrow keys. At any given position, the player is able to stop and use their trackpad/mouse to get a 360Â° view through their camera. The minimap feature provides a top-down view of the map and all the microfauna and can be used to show relative direction and location in the game!
